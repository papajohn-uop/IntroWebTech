Python requests library
In a file with name lab1-1.py write python code using the requests library that:

    asks for a URL and prints the HTTP response headers.
    modify the code so it returns following information:
        (a) which software is the web server using?
        (b) does the web page store cookies on the client side, and if yes
        (c) for how long will the cookie be valid?


In a file with name lab1-2.py write code which:
    In http://ds.upatras.gr/ there is a (Greek) web form which given the Surname, E-mail or Phone of a UPatras employee, returns a page with contact information. Note that the form sends the request with the HTTP POST method.

    asks the user to give the Surname of an employee, then makes a request to the ds.upatras.gr page and prints the e-mail address of the employee or a message if not found.
    modify the code so that also the phone number(s) of the employee are printed.
    modify the code so that if more than one employees are found, the data for all of them are printed.

    Make sure that the names you request are written in Greek. You can try "Αβούρης" for example to get the contact details of a single person, and "Παπα" to get the details of all employees whose name starts with those four letters.
