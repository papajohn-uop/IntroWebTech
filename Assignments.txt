Python requests library
In a file with name lab1-1.py write python code using the requests library that:

    asks for a URL and prints the HTTP response headers.
    modify the code so it returns following information:
        (a) which software is the web server using?
        (b) does the web page store cookies on the client side, and if yes
        (c) for how long will the cookie be valid?
